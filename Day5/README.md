The xFusionCorp Industries ML team uses a Makefile to orchestrate common tasks—data processing, training, testing, and cleanup. A draft Makefile exists at /root/code/fraud-detection/Makefile, but make all does not complete successfully. Bring the Makefile in line with the team's standard.

Change into /root/code/fraud-detection/ and run make all to observe the current failure.

The corrected Makefile must declare the following six targets and behaviour:

setup – Creates a virtual environment at mlops-venv/ and installs dependencies from requirements.txt;
data – Runs python src/data/process_data.py;
train – Runs python src/models/train.py;
test – Runs pytest tests/;
clean – Recursively removes every __pycache__ directory, removes .pytest_cache, and clears the contents of models/;
all – Runs setup, data, train, and test in that order.
All six target names must be declared as .PHONY so that Make never confuses them with files of the same name.

After your changes, make all must complete without error.

Makefile recipes must be indented with a real tab character, not spaces. Make rejects any recipe that is not tab-indented.

=> When i do make all the it gives issue of indentation 
then all other required added inside makefile and perform make all

Makefile
# fraud-detection Makefile
.PHONY: setup data train test clean all

setup:
python3 -m venv mlops-venv && mlops-venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

data:
python src/data/process_data.py

train:
python src/models/train.py

test:
pytest tests/

clean:
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
rm -rf .pytest_cache
rm -rf models/*
all: setup data train 

After this Run the following  
# make all
