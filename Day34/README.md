The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team evaluates fraud-detection candidates with k-fold cross-validation so every candidate is measured<br>
on multiple folds of an imbalanced dataset. A draft cross-validation scaffold exists at /root/code/fraud-detection/src/models/cross_validate.py,<br>
but its report does not match the release checklist and the fold strategy does not preserve the class ratio. Your task is to correct the scaffold<br>
so the cross-validation report lands in the expected shape.<br>


1) The MLflow tracking server is already running on port 5000. The MLflow UI button at the top of the lab can be opened to confirm—the dashboard<br>
loads with an empty fraud-detection-cv experiment.<br>

2) The project layout under /root/code/fraud-detection/:<br>
      * data/train.csv – A pre-generated 200-row synthetic binary-classification dataset with an imbalanced class split (roughly 70 / 30).<br>
Do not regenerate it.
      * src/models/cross_validate.py – The cross-validation scaffold. Every concern other than the splitter and the aggregate schema is correctly<br>
wired: fold iteration, per-fold metric computation, nested MLflow runs under a parent, JSON persistence, and artefact logging.<br>
      * reports/ – Where the cross-validation report must land.
3) Open src/models/cross_validate.py in the VS Code editor, correct the two problems that keep the report from meeting the release checklist,<br>
save, and run the script.<br>

4) The end state must include:<br>
      * A file at /root/code/fraud-detection/reports/cv_results.json (absolute path, inside the project's reports directory).
      * That JSON contains exactly these seven top-level keys: mean_accuracy, std_accuracy, mean_f1, std_f1, mean_roc_auc, std_roc_auc, folds.<br>
Every mean_* and std_* value is numeric.<br>
      * The folds value is a list of five per-fold dictionaries; each carries the keys fold, accuracy, f1, roc_auc.
      * The cross-validation splitter is stratification-aware – Each fold preserves the dataset's class ratio.
      * One parent MLflow run in the fraud-detection-cv experiment with five nested children (fold-1 through fold-5), each logging the per-fold metrics.

StratifiedKFold is already imported at the top of the scaffold—no new imports are required. The fix is confined to the CV splitter and the aggregate<br>
dict.<br>
=> corrected cross_validate.py<br>
```bash
"""Cross-validation evaluator for the fraud-detection model.

Runs k-fold cross-validation, logs every fold as a nested MLflow run
under a single parent, and writes an aggregate report at
`reports/cv_results.json`.

Every non-end-state concern is correctly wired — fold iteration,
metric computation, parent + child MLflow runs, artefact logging.
Adjust the CV splitter and the aggregate dict so the report
matches the schema the release checklist requires.

After this run the following command by going root of project directory<br>
```test
python3 src/models/cross_validate.py
```
it gives output with five nested child runs (fold-1 through fold-5).<br>
