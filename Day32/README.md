The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team's audit pipeline depends on run-to-run reproducibility—identical code and identical data must<br> 
produce identical metrics. The fraud-detection trainer at /root/code/fraud-detection/src/models/train.py currently fails this guarantee:<br> 
consecutive runs on the same dataset report different accuracy and F1 values. Your task is to make the trainer deterministic <br>
so the check_determinism.sh probe succeeds.<br>


1) The MLflow tracking server is already running on port 5000. The MLflow UI button at the top of the lab can be opened to confirm—the <br>
dashboard loads with an empty fraud-detection-repro experiment.<br>

2) The project layout under /root/code/fraud-detection/:
      * data/train.csv – A pre-generated 200-row synthetic binary classification dataset. The same file is read by both runs.
      * src/models/train.py – The trainer (non-deterministic on purpose). Every non-reproducibility concern is correctly wired; only the seed 
discipline is missing.
      * check_determinism.sh – Executable probe that runs the trainer three times, writes reports/metrics_run_1.json, reports/metrics_run_2.json,
and reports/metrics_run_3.json, and diffs each adjacent pair. Exits 0 only when all three JSON files are byte-identical.
      * models/ – Where each run persists its serialised model.
      * reports/ – Where each run writes its metrics JSON.
3) Running /root/code/fraud-detection/check_determinism.sh currently prints FAIL: the three runs did not produce byte-identical metrics. 
followed by a diff. Open src/models/train.py in the VS Code editor, add the seed discipline required by scikit-learn's randomised 
operations, save, and re-run the probe.

4) The end state must include:
      * check_determinism.sh exits with status 0.
      * At least two runs exist in the fraud-detection-repro experiment, named repro-run-1 and repro-run-2, with identical metrics.accuracy 
and metrics.f1_score values (to at least six decimal places).
      * All three probe runs produce byte-identical metrics JSON files at reports/metrics_run_1.json, reports/metrics_run_2.json, 
and reports/metrics_run_3.json – Covering accuracy, f1_score, and the model's feature_importances.

Only train.py needs to change. The probe, the dataset, and the MLflow wiring are all correct and must not be modified.

=> first i run ./check_determinism.sh by going to given directory path, so it gives error<br>
```ui
  FAIL: the three runs did not produce byte-identical metrics.
```
Added a constant after the existing constants in train.py<br>
```tr
  SEED = 42
```  
Add random_state=SEED in both methods i.e train_test_split,RandomForestClassifier<br>
  
corrected train.py<br>
```bash
"""Training script for the fraud-detection model.

This scaffold is deliberately non-deterministic — running it twice
produces different metrics on the same input data. A reproducibility
fix is required so downstream tooling (checksum-based caching,
experiment comparison, audit trails) can rely on run-to-run
stability.

Every non-reproducibility concern is already handled here — data
loading, split, training, MLflow logging, model persistence, and
metrics serialisation. Edit this file to add the seed discipline
that makes the run reproducible; do not change anything else.

1) first i did

it return 0 as output.
2) Check two runs which have identical values.
3) All three probe runs produce byte-identical metrics JSON files at reports/metrics_run_1.json, reports/metrics_run_2.json, and
