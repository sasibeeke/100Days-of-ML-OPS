The xFusionCorp Industries deployment team needs a batch-prediction wrapper around the registered fraud-detector champion model, complete with 
custom preprocessing, before the model is exposed to downstream services. The wrapper class is pre-written. 
Your task is to complete the MLflow-side plumbing that loads the champion and runs the batch.<br>

1) The MLflow tracking server is already running on port 5000. The MLflow UI button at the top of the lab can be opened to view the dashboard;
   the Models tab shows fraud-detector registered with a champion alias on version 1.

2) Open /root/code/predict_with_preprocessing.py in the VS Code editor. The ScaledPredictor class (a pyfunc wrapper that applies per-column
   mean/std scaling inside its .predict() method) and the MODEL_URI / INPUT_CSV / OUTPUT_CSV constants at the top of the file are already
   written and must NOT be modified. Two # TODO blocks remain:
    * TODO 1: Load the champion version of fraud-detector from MLflow's Model Registry into a variable named inner_model. MODEL_URI is already set to
       models:/fraud-detector@champion.
    * TODO 2: Run the batch prediction over the pre-staged inputs, attach the predictions as a new prediction column on the inputs DataFrame, and
      write the result to OUTPUT_CSV (/root/code/predictions.csv) with index=False.
3) After both TODOs are completed, run the script once:
   ```te
   python3 /root/code/predict_with_preprocessing.py
   ```
   
The end state must include:
  * A file at /root/code/predictions.csv with a header row.
  * A prediction column in that CSV.
  * The number of prediction rows equal to the number of input rows in /root/code/data/inputs.csv (ten).<br>

"""
MLflow model serving — two TODO blocks wire a pyfunc wrapper with
custom preprocessing around the registered champion model and run a
batch prediction on the pre-staged synthetic input file.

The `ScaledPredictor` class (including the mean/std scaling logic
in `.predict()`) is already written — the lab exercises the serving
plumbing (loading the registry champion by alias, wiring it into
the pyfunc wrapper, producing a predictions CSV), not preprocessing
theory.

The input file at /root/code/data/inputs.csv is a deterministic
synthetic 10-row numeric batch. No real ML workflow; the prediction
values carry no meaning beyond "the pyfunc ran end to end".

A prediction column in the header
10 prediction rows (11 lines total including the header)
