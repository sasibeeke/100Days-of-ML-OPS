The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team tunes fraud-detection hyperparameters with Optuna and inspects the full search in the MLflow <br>
Compare view. A draft tuner exists at /root/code/fraud-detection/src/models/tune.py, but the search optimises in the wrong direction and no<br>
trials ever land on the tracking server. Your task is to correct the tuner so each of the 20 trials is visible in MLflow and the saved best <br>
configuration is actually the highest-F1 candidate.<br>

The MLflow tracking server is already running on port 5000. The MLflow UI button at the top of the lab can be opened to confirm—the dashboard 
loads with an empty hyperopt-tuning experiment.<br>

The project layout under /root/code/fraud-detection/:<br>
    * data/train.csv – The same 200-row synthetic binary-classification dataset Day 34 uses (imbalanced roughly 70 / 30).<br>
    * src/models/tune.py – The Optuna tuner scaffold. Fold iteration, metric averaging, Optuna study creation, and YAML persistence are already
    wired corrections are required.
    * configs/ – Where best_params.yaml is written after the search completes.<br>
    * Open src/models/tune.py in the VS Code editor, correct every issue that keeps the search from meeting the release checklist, save, and run the 
script once.

The end state must include:<br>
    1) At least 20 runs exist in the hyperopt-tuning experiment on MLflow. Every run carries params.n_estimators, params.max_depth, and <br> metrics.f1_score.
    2) A YAML file at /root/code/fraud-detection/configs/best_params.yaml with exactly two keys: n_estimators (integer in the range [50, 500]) <br>
and max_depth (integer in the range [3, 20]).<br>
    3) The Optuna study is directed such that best_params corresponds to the highest-F1 trial in the search space – Not the lowest.<br>
=> corrected tune.py <br>
```bash
"""Hyperparameter tuner for the fraud-detection RandomForest.

Uses Optuna to sample `n_estimators` and `max_depth` across 20
trials, evaluates each candidate via 3-fold stratified cross-
validation on the synthetic training set, and writes the best
configuration to `configs/best_params.yaml`.

Every trial must land in the MLflow `hyperopt-tuning` experiment
as an independent run so the full search can be inspected in the
Compare view — the per-trial hyperparameters logged as run
parameters and the resulting mean f1 as a run metric named
`f1_score`.

The scaffold below already implements fold iteration, metric
averaging, and the Optuna / YAML wiring. Two corrections remain
before the search produces the configuration the release checklist
requires.
