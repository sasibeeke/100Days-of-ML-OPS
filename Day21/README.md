A xFusionCorp Industries data scientist needs a training run recorded in MLflow so the team has a baseline record on the tracking dashboard. <br>
The non-MLflow scaffolding has already been written at /root/code/log_experiment.py; the MLflow logging calls are left as TODO blocks. <br>
Your task is to complete the script so that every element of the run is captured by the MLflow tracking server.<br>


The MLflow tracking server is already running on port 5000. The MLflow UI button at the top of the lab can be opened to view the dashboard;<br>
the Default experiment is present on first load.<br>

/root/code/log_experiment.py can be opened in the VS Code editor. <br>
The script prepares a params dictionary, fits a trivial sklearn model, and advertises a pair of synthetic evaluation scores (accuracy and f1).<br> 
Three blocks marked # TODO inside the mlflow.start_run() context are the only edits required.<br>

Execute the script once (python3 /root/code/log_experiment.py) after the TODOs are completed.<br>
The end state must include:<br>

1) Exactly one new run in the Default experiment.<br>
2) Every hyperparameter in the params dict (n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=42) recorded as a run parameter.<br>
3) Both advertised scores (accuracy, f1_score) recorded as run metrics.<br>
4) The sklearn model captured as an MLflow model artefact on the run.<br>
The result can be confirmed in the MLflow UI—once the run is opened, the Parameters, Metrics, and Artifacts panels each show the expected content.<br>
=> Corrected log_experiment.py

"""
MLflow experiment logging — three TODO blocks below record a training
run with MLflow.

The model and metric values in this script are synthetic. A trivial
DummyClassifier stands in for a trained model so that the MLflow
logging calls have a real sklearn estimator and deterministic numeric
metrics to persist. The purpose of the lab is to practise the MLflow
logging API, not to reason about model quality.

The three `# TODO` blocks inside the `mlflow.start_run()` context
are the only edits required.
