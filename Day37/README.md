The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team runs fraud-detection training as a four-stage pipeline—preprocess, featurize, train, <br>
evaluate—orchestrated by a single script that logs the end-to-end run to MLflow. A pre-staged pipeline is already in place, but the stage-chain<br> 
invariant is broken: the pipeline currently produces a feature matrix that does not reflect the upstream drop-and-clean work. Your task is to <br>
correct the stage wiring so every stage reads from its immediate predecessor and one MLflow run captures the full pipeline.<br>

1) The MLflow tracking server is already running on port 5000. The MLflow UI button at the top of the lab can be opened to confirm—the dashboard
loads with an empty training-pipeline experiment.<br>
3) The project layout under /root/code/fraud-detection/:<br>
      * data/raw/train.csv – The same 200-row synthetic binary-classification dataset the rest of the Training section uses (imbalanced roughly 70 / 30).
      * configs/pipeline_config.yaml – Declares the data paths, model hyperparameters, output paths, and MLflow settings every stage consumes.
        Correct and must remain intact.
      * src/preprocess.py, src/featurize.py, src/train.py, src/evaluate.py – The four pipeline stages. preprocess.py drops negligible-amount rows
        (amount < 50) and duplicates before writing the processed CSV. The four stages are wired through the config's data: paths.
      * run_pipeline.py – The orchestrator that executes the four stages in order and logs one MLflow run with the config-driven parameters and
        the final evaluation metrics. Correct and requires no edits.
4) Identify the stage whose input path breaks the chain, correct the wiring in the VS Code editor, save, and run python3 run_pipeline.py once from
   the project root.
6) The end state must include:<br>
      * The row count of data/features/features.csv equals the row count of data/processed/train_clean.csv and is strictly less than the 200-row raw CSV.
      * models/model.pkl and reports/evaluation.json are written and the report carries accuracy, f1, and roc_auc as numeric values.
      * Exactly one MLflow run exists in the training-pipeline experiment, carrying params.model_type, params.n_estimators, params.max_depth,
        and the three evaluation metrics.
=> corrected feature.py<br>
```bash
"""Stage 2 — Featurize.

Reads the upstream stage's output, engineers one derived column
(`amount_log = log1p(amount)`), and writes the feature matrix to
`data/features/features.csv` for the training stage to consume.

Every concern other than the input wiring is correctly in place —
feature engineering, column preservation, on-disk layout. Adjust
the input source so the stage-chain invariant holds: the row count
out of this stage must match the row count the preprocess stage
produced.

After that run the pipeline<br>
```test
python3 run_pipeline.py
```
Verfiy the output by using <br>
  1) processed row count == features row count
  2) Verify model and report at models/ and reports/ location with parameters
  3) In mlflow UI pipeline experiment carries one evaluation run with params.model_type, params.n_estimators, params.max_depth, and the three evaluation 
metrics.
